# hello-world
My first repository on GitHub.

Aditya here. I like to learn, think and program.
I know C, C++, Python, JAVA, HTML, CSS, some JavaScript and MySQL.

Additionally, I have recently been inclined into studying Machine Learning and am currently loving working with Octave.

I am basically an Information Security engineer in-the-making, so the primary area of interest, however, is Information Security.
I have also completed an internship in the field of cybersecurity at Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY), Govt. of India and am familiar with the procedure to convert protocols into High-Level Protocol Specification Language (HLPSL) specification and with the working of latest tools such as SPAN/AVISPA to analyse internet security-sensitive protocols.
